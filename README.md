# unity-SquareScriptableTileLearning
Project developed while learning scriptable object capability in Unity (aka Bugs Eat Grass)

Unity project developed from watching and following along with YouTube videos from "The Game Dev Shack"

Instead of using fire to burn tiles and adding stink from follow on videos, my version;
- Starting with a single bug that wanders over time
- Bugs eat grass degrading grass over time
- Grass grows back over time as long as some remains on tile
- Bugs replicate over time, amount of grass in tile determines bug replication rate and tile graphic
- Bugs die after a fixed lifetime
